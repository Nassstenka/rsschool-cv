## Summary
My goal is to become a **full-stack developer**. At the moment, I'm learning *web-design* and *frontend development*. I'm trying to learn more about JS and its frameworks. In the future, I want to master the *backend* as well.

## Skills
I had programming experience in such languages as: *Delphi, C, Assembler, C++, C#*. Also had a little study experience in *Java* and *Ruby*. I'm pretty good at *HTML5* and *CSS3*.

## CodeExamples
```javascript
function isPrime(num) {
  if (num < 2) return false;
  else {
    for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(num); i++) {
      if (num % i === 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
  }
}
```

## Education
I'm the third-year student of BSUIR.
